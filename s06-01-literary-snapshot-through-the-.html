    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">Lewis Carroll is most famous for two books: <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865)<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn02_001">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p04">Alice finds herself challenged to make sense of a world inhabited by odd creatures—some human, some not—who exist in a world that seems like nonsense. Throughout her adventures, Alice attempts to apply logic to her experiences; in other words, Alice tries to interpret and find meaning in Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p05">Alice acts like a literary critic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p06">One scene in <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em> will be the keynote of this chapter, as we see Alice encountering Humpty Dumpty, who proceeds to interpret a poem that Alice stumbled on earlier in her journey.</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p08">There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, “—for it’s all in some language I don’t know,” she said to herself.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p15">We have all felt like Alice. What is that creature I’m battling? Sometimes poetry is the Jabberwock. Have you ever read Wallace Stevens’s “The Emperor of Ice-Cream”? Let’s do so now:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_p17">Some may find Stevens’s poem as confusing as “Jabberwocky.” And like Alice, we desire to understand, to find meaning in order to appreciate the literary work. This is where a close reading, which focuses on form, becomes the foundation of all literary analysis.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">See, you did feel like Alice. She states that “<em class="emphasis">somebody</em> killed <em class="emphasis">something</em>” after her initial reading, but she realizes that her interpretation is not yet adequate. She needs to dig deeper in the text to extract more meaning. And here is where she meets Humpty Dumpty, who professes to be an excellent literary critic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Let’s listen in again.

            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p03">“You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,” said Alice. “Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called ‘Jabberwocky’?”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p04">“Let’s hear it,” said Humpty Dumpty. “I can explain all the poems that were ever invented—and a good many that haven’t been invented just yet.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p05">This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:</p>
            <p class="para">  “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
            <p class="para">  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p06">“That’s enough to begin with,” Humpty Dumpty interrupted: “there are plenty of hard words there. ‘<em class="emphasis">Brillig</em>’ means four o’clock in the afternoon—the time when you begin <em class="emphasis">broiling</em> things for dinner.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p07">“That’ll do very well,” said Alice: “and ‘<em class="emphasis">slithy</em>’?”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p08">“Well, ‘<em class="emphasis">slithy</em>’ means ‘lithe and slimy.’ ‘Lithe’ is the same as ‘active.’ You see it’s like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p09">“I see it now,” Alice remarked thoughtfully: “and what are ‘<em class="emphasis">toves</em>’?”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p10">“Well, ‘<em class="emphasis">toves</em>’ are something like badgers—they’re something like lizards—and they’re something like corkscrews.”</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p11">“They must be very curious looking creatures.”</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p14">“To ‘<em class="emphasis">gyre</em>’ is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To ‘<em class="emphasis">gimble</em>’ is to make holes like a gimlet.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p15">“And ‘<em class="emphasis">the wabe</em>’ is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?” said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p16">“Of course it is. It’s called ‘<em class="emphasis">wabe</em>,’ you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it—”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p17">“And a long way beyond it on each side,” Alice added.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p18">“Exactly so. Well, then, ‘<em class="emphasis">mimsy</em>’ is ‘flimsy and miserable’ (there’s another portmanteau for you).

            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p20">“Well, a ‘<em class="emphasis">rath</em>’ is a sort of green pig: but ‘<em class="emphasis">mome</em>’ I’m not certain about. I think it’s short for ‘from home’—meaning that they’d lost their way, you know.”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p21">“And what does ‘<em class="emphasis">outgrabe</em>’ mean?”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p22">“Well, ‘<em class="emphasis">outgrabing</em>’ is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you’ll hear it done, maybe—down in the wood yonder—and when you’ve once heard it you’ll be <em class="emphasis">quite</em> content. Who’s been repeating all that hard stuff to you?”</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p23">“I read it in a book,” said Alice.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn02_005">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1899; University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center, 1993), chap. 6, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p24">Carroll, of course, is parodying the literary critic, for Humpty Dumpty’s interpretation is even more nonsensical than the poem itself! Yet we must give the egg some credit: he attempts to interpret a difficult poem—he performs as a literary critic by providing an interpretation of “Jabberwocky.”</p>
