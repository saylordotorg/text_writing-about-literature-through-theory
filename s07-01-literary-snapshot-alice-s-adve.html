</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">We are becoming acquainted more and more with our young hero Alice, who has had some literary theory adventures in <a class="xref" href="pennington_1.0-ch01#pennington_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction: What Is Literary Theory and Why Should I Care?"</a> and <a class="xref" href="pennington_1.0-ch02#pennington_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Writing about Form: Developing the Foundations of Close Reading"</a>. Let’s continue our journey with Alice in this chapter as we explore psychoanalytic literary criticism. We’ll provide the links to Carroll’s text again, just in case:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p04">When Alice tumbles down the rabbit-hole in <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865), she enters a fantasy realm that is quite different from her world of the here-and-now:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p05">Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of dry leaves, and the fall was over.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_001">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p06">Her adventures are described as a dream, and she exclaims after the fall that it was all “Curiouser and curiouser!”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p07">In <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em> (1872), Alice, after entering Looking-Glass Land via a magic mirror, encounters two odd brothers, Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Alice and the brothers come upon the Red King, who is snoring:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p08">“It’s only the Red King snoring,” said Tweedledee.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p09">“Come and look at him!” the brothers cried, and they each took one of Alice’s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p10">“Isn’t he a <em class="emphasis">lovely</em> sight?” said Tweedledum. Alice couldn’t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring loud—“fit to snore his head off!” as Tweedledum remarked.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p11">“I’m afraid he’ll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,” said Alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p12">“He’s dreaming now,” said Tweedledee: “and what do you think he’s dreaming about?”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p13">Alice said, “Nobody can guess that.”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p14">“Why, about <em class="emphasis">you</em>!” Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly. “And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you’d be?”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p15">“Where I am now, of course,” said Alice.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p16">“Not you!” Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. “You’d be nowhere. Why, you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p17">“If that there King was to wake,” added Tweedledum, “you’d go out—bang!—just like a candle!”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p18">“I shouldn’t!” Alice exclaimed indignantly. “Besides, if <em class="emphasis">I’m</em> only a sort of thing in his dream, what are <em class="emphasis">you, I</em> should like to know?”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p19">“Ditto,” said Tweedledum.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p20">“Ditto, ditto!” cried Tweedledee.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p21">He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn’t help saying, “Hush! You’ll be waking him, I’m afraid, if you make so much noise.”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p22">“Well, it’s no use <em class="emphasis">your</em> talking about waking him,” said Tweedledum, “when you’re only one of the things in his dream. You know very well you’re not real.”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p23">“I <em class="emphasis bolditalic">am</em> real!” said Alice, and began to cry.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p50">“You won’t make yourself a bit realer by crying,” Tweedledee remarked: “there’s nothing to cry about.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_002">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1899; University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center, 1993), chap. 4, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html</a>.</span></p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p24">The dream in Looking-Glass Land seems more a nightmare for Alice, for she is scared that she is merely a figment of someone’s dream, their imagination—that’s an idea that might bring us all to tears!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p25">We all have dreams, and we recognize that dreams often mirror the oddness and nonsense that Alice encounters in Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land. Dreams, in fact, are central to psychoanalytic literary criticism and have become the stuff of popular psychology, where dream interpretation continues to be a lucrative industry, as seen at Dream-Books.net (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://dream-books.net/popPsychology-dream-books.html">http://dream-books.net/popPsychology-dream-books.html</a>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s01_p26">Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, famously defines dreams as the “road to the unconsciousness” in his monumental work <em class="emphasis">The Interpretation of Dreams</em> (1899).<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_003">Sigmund Freud, <em class="emphasis">The Interpretation of Dreams</em>.</span></p>
