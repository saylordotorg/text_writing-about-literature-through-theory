            <li>Assign each group one critic: Freud, Lacan, or Jung.</li>
            <li>Have them discuss ways to apply their theory to the poem.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s06_p01">Keats’s “Urn,” as you have discovered, lends itself well to the psychoanalytic perspective. Compare the classroom discussion with some critical applications of psychoanalytic theory to Keats’s poem. Leon Waldoff in <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (1985), for example, demonstrates how Keats’s loss of family members creates “feelings of separation anxiety,” especially the loss of his mother and brother Tom.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_029">Leon Waldoff, <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985).</span> This loss becomes manifest in “an unconscious determinant” that creates key symbols in Keats’s odes, the Grecian urn being an example.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_030">Leon Waldoff, <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985).</span> The urn symbolizes, argues Waldoff, an “undying longing for permanence” that symbolizes an “unending quest conducted at the deepest levels of the mind by the silent work of the imagination, which repeatedly seeks to heal an insistent sense of loss and to deal with its more conscious complement—a penetrating awareness of the transience of human life and a concern with philosophical questions raised by that awareness.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_031">Leon Waldoff, <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985).</span> The urn, like the other artifacts in Keats’s odes (nightingale, autumn, melancholy), shows “the fundamental impossibility of controlling imagination and the desire impelling it toward a finer conception of its object.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_032">Leon Waldoff, <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985).</span> Waldoff contends Keats’s melancholia that results from familial loss “provides a structure or context within which the unconscious processes evident in the poetry may be seen to work with cohesion and unity of purpose in the direction they give to the imagination.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_033">Leon Waldoff, <em class="emphasis">Keats and the Silent Work of Imagination</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985).</span> Keats’s life, then, is the key subtext that is the foundation of the odes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s06_p02">A Lacanian reading could extend Waldoff’s argument: the poet, unable to regain the lost past, attempts through poetry to fulfill this desire for his mother and brothers. The urn is an object of desire—<em class="emphasis">objet petit a</em>—that acts as a temporary anchoring point for the poet. However, since the poem generates meaning through language, and since language cannot fulfill desire, the urn image ultimately fails to fulfill; it is a “Cold Pastoral.” Keats’s repetition of the word <em class="emphasis">happy</em> in stanza three—“More happy love! more happy, happy love”; “Ah, happy, happy boughs”; “And happy melodist”—reflects the emptiness of language that tries to capture true desire. <em class="emphasis">Happy</em> can only approximate “happiness,” the signified that the poet wishes to convey. In a sense, Keats’s poem attempts to reach the Real to satiate the longing to move from the Symbolic realm that continually frustrates fulfillment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch03_s06_p03">Finally, in <em class="emphasis">The Nightingale and the Hawk: A Psychological Study of Keats’s Odes</em> (1964), Katharine M. Wilson provides a Jungian interpretation of the odes. She argues that Keats’s odes are attempts to tap into the archetypal collective unconsciousness, for poetry works by “images…which come from the deeper layers of the poet’s psyche, rather than from his superficial observation, or from his personal unconscious.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_034">Katharine M. Wilson, <em class="emphasis">The Nightingale and the Hawk: A Psychological Study of Keats’s Odes</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1964).</span> The odes are Keats’s “quest for the Self.” In “Urn,” in particular, “beauty for Keats was entangled with intimation of the Self”; thus beauty’s “permanence lies in the realm of the psyche.” “The urn is like a frozen archetype,” argues Wilson. “It is a permanent object passed from generation to generation of sorrowing humanity, but has fixed on its objects of beauty.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn03_035">Katharine M. Wilson, <em class="emphasis">The Nightingale and the Hawk: A Psychological Study of Keats’s Odes</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1964).</span> The urn, consequently, as frozen archetype epitomizes truth and beauty that resides in the Self, that Self tapping the larger collective unconscious for its images.</p>
