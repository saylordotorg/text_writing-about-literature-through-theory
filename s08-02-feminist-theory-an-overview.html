    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p05">The recipes reflect a particular view of women and their role in the domestic space. In other words, the woman’s domain is in the house, her workspace the kitchen, where she will cook for her husband (and by extension the children). Notice that each recipe privileges the male name, with the woman’s maiden name—her original name and identity—put in parenthesis. Even the use of <em class="emphasis">Mrs.</em> denotes her married status, whereby <em class="emphasis">Mr.</em> does not tell us the married status of the male. We are in the realm of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">patriarchy</a><span class="glossdef">Ideology, or belief system of a society, of male domination over women that pervades the public and private spheres.</span></span>, the condition that demonstrates male domination over women. The recipes are even more interesting, for the section of this cookbook is “Game,” further suggesting particular gender roles: men, the sportsmen, go hunting for this game, while the women, remaining at home, cook up that game for the family. If we interpret these recipes as we might a piece of literature, we can identify particular themes that represent feminist criticism: women are inferior to men in patriarchy; women’s space is the private place of domesticity, the man’s space is public (in this case the rugged wild); the woman’s identity is determined by her husband’s identity (she, like Eve, is dependent on her husband’s rib, so to speak).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p06">Now let’s look at a literary use of the kitchen as a domestic space. Here is the cast of characters and opening set description for Susan Glaspell’s one-act play, <em class="emphasis">Trifles</em> (1916). The play was first performed by the Provincetown Players in Massachusetts, with Glaspell playing the role of Mrs. Hale. A year later, Glaspell turned the play into a short story, “A Jury of Her Peers,” partly to reach a larger reading audience. The inspiration for the play came from a murder reported in the <em class="emphasis">Des Moines Register</em>.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_008">Articles on case: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.midnightassassin.com/sgarticles.html">http://www.midnightassassin.com/sgarticles.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p09">WHEN Martha Hale opened the storm-door and got a cut of the north wind, she ran back for her big woolen scarf. As she hurriedly wound that round her head her eye made a scandalized sweep of her kitchen. It was no ordinary thing that called her away—it was probably farther from ordinary than anything that had ever happened in Dickson County. But what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving; her bread all ready for mixing, half the flour sifted and half unsifted.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p10">She hated to see things half done; but she had been at that when the team from town stopped to get Mr. Hale, and then the sheriff came running in to say his wife wished Mrs. Hale would come too—adding, with a grin, that he guessed she was getting scarey and wanted another woman along.

            <li>Students should then fill in the chart: what symbols are associated with the men and women?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p11">When we turn to the <em class="emphasis">Trifles</em> example, we see how a writer uses this domestic space and its implications to create a symbolic statement about gender. The men all have first and last names and are given an occupation (attorney, sheriff, or farmer); the women are only known by their husband’s names—they are not even given first names. This naming becomes important in the play, for the suspected murderer Minnie Wright is referred to as Minnie Foster by Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale, suggesting that she had lost her identity by marrying her husband, who was a cold and cruel man, even preventing her from singing in the choir or having a telephone in the house (see Gretchen Panzer’s sample paper on voice in <em class="emphasis">The Great Gatsby</em> later in the chapter).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p12">Furthermore, the setting of the play is important—all the action on stage takes place in the kitchen, a kitchen that is in disarray. The men, of course, view the messy kitchen as a fault of Minnie’s: she just isn’t a very good housewife and housekeeper, for that is her primary role according to the men. To be a housewife, in addition, means that women are only concerned with “trifles,” insignificant things. Later in the play and the short story we find out that Minnie’s canning—her preserves—have been ruined because the jars have frozen and burst. Again, the men see this as sloppy housekeeping, while the women view the preserves as Minnie’s hard work to care for her family. The idea of “preserves” or “preservation” becomes a central theme in Glaspell’s work, for Minnie must preserve her dignity as a woman, even if it means that she must murder her husband. The great irony of the play and short story is that the women discover the evidence—the strangled bird—that would be enough to convict Minnie of murder, but they withhold this evidence, thus implying that Minnie will be set free. The women create their own justice system, becoming a jury of their peers: women.</p>

Ah, that is the question,” a befuddled Hamlet might ask. A useful definition can be found in Michael Kimmel and Thomas Mosmiller’s <em class="emphasis">Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History</em> (1992).

        <li>There is evidence that women are treated differently and unequally.</li>

        <li>If these points are true, then that’s wrong and becomes a moral problem.</li>
        <li>Thus feminism is a commitment to change.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_011">Michael Kimmel and Thomas Mosmiller, <em class="emphasis">Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990 a Documentary History</em> (Boston: Beacon, 1992).</span>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p14">Two other definitions will be useful to you: Barbara Smith argues that “feminism is the political theory and practice that struggles to free <em class="emphasis">all</em> women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, disabled women, Jewish women, lesbians, old women—as well as white, economically privileged, heterosexual women. Anything less than this vision of total freedom is not feminism, but merely female self-aggrandizement.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_012">from <em class="emphasis">A History of U.S. Feminisms</em> by Kory Dicker (Berkeley, CA: Seal Press, 2008), p. 7.</span> Noted feminist author bell hooks adds, “Feminism is a struggle to end sexist oppression. Therefore it is necessarily a struggle to eradicate the ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on various levels, as well as a commitment to reorganize society so that the self-development of people can take precedence over imperialism, economic expansion, and material desires.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_013">bell hooks, <em class="emphasis">Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center</em>, 2nd ed. (London: Pluto, 2000).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p15">Feminist literary criticism is also about this commitment to equality, to change, and it works its way by arguing that literature is a powerful cultural force that mirrors gender attitudes. Feminist literary criticism can be categorized into three stages: patriarchal criticism, gynocriticism, and feminine writing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p16"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Patriarchal criticism</a><span class="glossdef">Literary method that examines how writers—particularly male writers—depict women in literature; this criticism often highlights the sexist stereotypes that privilege men over women.</span></span> examines the prejudices against women by male writers. Such criticism analyzes the way that canonical authors—mostly men—create images of women. For example, Gretchen Panzer’s sample paper in this chapter explores how F. Scott Fitzgerald silences Daisy Buchanan in <em class="emphasis">The Great Gatsby</em>, further reinforcing the notion that this great American novel depicts women in demeaning ways.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_014">F. Scott Fitzgerald, <em class="emphasis">The Great Gatsby</em> (New York: Scribner, 2003).</span> This criticism is often focused on close textual study since it will examine how men and women are depicted in literary texts. Patriarchal criticism will be central to this chapter.</p>

Another interesting example is the evolution of <em class="emphasis">The Norton Anthology of English Literature</em>, which reflects the insertion of women into the canon. The edition for 1968,<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_016">M. H. Abrams, ed., <em class="emphasis">The Norton Anthology of English Literature</em>, rev. ed. (New York: W. W.

Abrams, eds., <em class="emphasis">The Norton Anthology of English Literature</em>, 8th ed. (New York: W. W.

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p18">What does it mean, consequently, when there are no representations of women? Historically, if women didn’t exist in the canon, then we did not—we could not—study them. But with the rise of the field of women’s studies in the 1960s, which introduced the idea of feminist literary criticism, we now value the study of women and their accomplishments, as well as thinking about how gender is constructed and perpetuated generally. This evolution about women and literature is mirrored in the evolving contents of the Norton anthology, which also reflects the evolving canon that is more inclusive, particularly to women writers.</p>

Richard J. Dunn (New York: Norton, 2001); Emily Brontë, <em class="emphasis">Wuthering Heights</em>, ed. Richard J. Dunn (New York: Norton, 2003).</span> To give another famous example, George Eliot, who wrote the Victorian classic <em class="emphasis">Middlemarch</em>, was actually Mary Ann Evans.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn04_020">George Eliot, <em class="emphasis">Middlemarch</em>, ed. Bert G. Hornback (New York: Norton, 2000).</span> The second stage of women’s writing is <strong class="emphasis bold">Protest</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Feminist</strong> (1880–1920), which sees women becoming much more political as writers, reacting directly to male domination in society and literature. Kate Chopin is an example of this stage, as is Virginia Woolf. Finally, the third stage, <strong class="emphasis bold">Self-Discovery</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Female</strong> (1920–), becomes more radical as women turn inward toward the female, toward the body, creating works that mirror a writing particular to women.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch04_s02_p20">As you can see, to narrowly define feminist literary criticism is difficult, for there are a myriad of approaches to take. Feminism is often referred to in the plural—feminisms—because there is such diversity within feminism about core terms and philosophies.
