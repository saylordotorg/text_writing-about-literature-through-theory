</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p01">Lewis Carroll, as we found out in previous chapters, is most famous for two books: <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865) and <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em> (1872). These books follow the adventures of the 7–year-old, Alice, who tumbles down a rabbit hole (<em class="emphasis">Wonderland</em>) and enters a magic mirror (<em class="emphasis">Looking-Glass</em>), entering a nonsensical world of the imagination. If you have not already read these classic books—or wish to reread them—you can access them at the following links:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p02"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarAlic.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarAlic.html</a></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">Alice finds herself challenged to make sense of a seemingly absurd world inhabited by odd creatures. Throughout her adventures, Alice attempts to apply logic to her experiences; in other words, Alice tries to interpret and find meaning in Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p05">Alice acts like a literary critic. In previous chapters, you became like Alice—that is, you learned about a literary theory and applied that theory as you analyzed a work of literature. This chapter asks you to reimagine your role as a literary critic: you will be asked to analyze not only the text but also the role of the reader in constructing meaning. In a sense, you will be asked to be a lot like Alice, trying to figure out your reading experience as you immerse yourself in a literary creation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p06">Our scene comes from chapter 10, “The Lobster-Quadrille” in <em class="emphasis">Wonderland</em>:</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p08">“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p11">Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would <em class="emphasis">ever</em> happen in a natural way again.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p12">“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p13">“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next verse.”</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p17">Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p19">“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_001">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p20">Alice finds herself reciting a poem about a Lobster and then continuing with a poem about an Owl and a Panther. Not only is Alice creating—that is, she makes up these poems—but she also requires the reader to finish the second poem:</p>

    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p21">“By eating the Owl!” The poem nudges the reader to complete the line by filling in the final ending to the poem: we know that the Panther will eat the Owl. Of course, a reader might complete the poem by writing, “by throwing in the towel,” or “by picking up a trowel,” “by running down the hall,” or even “with an even greater howl.” In any case, you, as the reader, have activated the text.</p>
