<span class="title-prefix">6.1</span> Literary Snapshot: <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>
</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p01">Lewis Carroll, as we found out in previous chapters, is most famous for two books: <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865) and <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em> (1872). These books follow the adventures of the 7–year-old, Alice, who tumbles down a rabbit hole (<em class="emphasis">Wonderland</em>) and enters a magic mirror (<em class="emphasis">Looking-Glass</em>), entering a nonsensical world of the imagination. If you have not already read these classic books—or wish to reread them—you can access them at the following links:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p02"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarAlic.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarAlic.html</a></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">Alice finds herself challenged to make sense of a seemingly absurd world inhabited by odd creatures. Throughout her adventures, Alice attempts to apply logic to her experiences; in other words, Alice tries to interpret and find meaning in Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p05">Alice acts like a literary critic. In previous chapters, you became like Alice—that is, you learned about a literary theory and applied that theory as you analyzed a work of literature. This chapter asks you to reimagine your role as a literary critic: you will be asked to analyze not only the text but also the role of the reader in constructing meaning. In a sense, you will be asked to be a lot like Alice, trying to figure out your reading experience as you immerse yourself in a literary creation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p06">Our scene comes from chapter 10, “The Lobster-Quadrille” in <em class="emphasis">Wonderland</em>:</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p17">Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p20">Alice finds herself reciting a poem about a Lobster and then continuing with a poem about an Owl and a Panther.

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s01_p21">“By eating the Owl!” The poem nudges the reader to complete the line by filling in the final ending to the poem: we know that the Panther will eat the Owl. Of course, a reader might complete the poem by writing, “by throwing in the towel,” or “by picking up a trowel,” “by running down the hall,” or even “with an even greater howl.” In any case, you, as the reader, have activated the text.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.2</span> Reader-Response Theory: An Overview</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">Let’s begin with the famous opening from Jane Austen’s <em class="emphasis">Emma</em> (1816):“Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_004">Jane Austen, <em class="emphasis">Emma</em> (New York: Penguin Classics, 2011).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">Oh, that Emma Woodhouse. “Handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition,” certainly, but also vain, proud, and a mischievous-matchmaker in those things related to love. Not much of a character to base a novel on, the reader might muse. Austen was nervous about her creation of Emma, for as she wrote in a letter: “I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.” Yet Austen does exactly this: in <em class="emphasis">Emma</em>, she creates a character that taxes the reader’s patience, one the author recognizes that readers may not like.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">Austen’s comments on Emma point to the fact that readers identify with characters in a novel. And we can extrapolate further: readers like or dislike what they read; readers are moved to joy, anger, sadness, and so on by a literary work; and readers read literature from a personal level. For an author, this “reader response” is of utmost importance, as Austen most certainly realizes. If readers do not like Emma, do not empathize with her on some emotional level, then they will dislike the novel.</p>
    <div class="exercises editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Class Process</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_l01">
            <li>List the literary works that you were told were great or important but that you actually disliked. Your instructor should also share his or her dislikes. This should lead to a lively discussion.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p04">You will see that “likes” and “dislikes” are important markers in reader-response theory. Here’s an example: in <em class="emphasis">Letters to Alice on First Reading Jane Austen</em> (1984), the author, Fay Weldon, writes to her niece Alice, trying to convince her of the importance of Austen. “You tell me in passing,” writes Weldon, “that you are doing a college course in English Literature, and are obliged to read Jane Austen; that you find her boring, petty and irrelevant and, that as the world is in crisis, and the future catastrophic, you cannot imagine what purpose there can be in your reading her.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_005">Fay Weldon, <em class="emphasis">Letters to Alice on First Reading Jane Austen</em> (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2011), 11.</span> Weldon responds, “<em class="emphasis">Emma</em> opens with a paragraph which sends shivers of pleasure down my spine: it glitters with sheer competence: with the animation of the writer who has discovered power: who is at ease in the pathways of the City of Invention. Here is Emma, exciting envy in the heart of the reader and also, one suspects, the writer—and now, she declares, Emma will be undone; and I, the writer, and you, the reader, will share in this experience.”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_006">Fay Weldon, <em class="emphasis">Letters to Alice on First Reading Jane Austen</em> (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2011), 96.</span> Weldon, of course, is responding to Austen on a very personal level—on the gut level we should say—which can make one have “shivers of pleasure” or “exciting envy” or “share in this [reading] experience.” What Weldon does to Austen and <em class="emphasis">Emma</em> is perform a reader-response interpretation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p05">Reader-response literary criticism recognizes the simple fact that readers respond to literature on an emotional level and that such responses are important to the understanding of the work. Long ago, even Aristotle recognized how important an audience’s reaction is to tragedy, for a key to tragedy is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">catharsis</a><span class="glossdef">An emotional release. The Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that plays, or literature, should provide this experience for their audience.</span></span>, the purging of the audience’s emotions. If you recall from <a class="xref" href="pennington_1.0-ch01#pennington_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction: What Is Literary Theory and Why Should I Care?"</a>, the concept of the <em class="emphasis">affective fallacy</em> was central to the New Critical methodology—a reader was never to confuse the interpretation of the literary work with the “feeling” she or he had while reading. These New Critics warned the reader that affective responses lead only to subjectivity; thus New Critics suggested that the reader pay close attention to the intricacies of the text under observation for meaning, for the text as a well-wrought urn contains meaning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p06">Reader-response critics, on the other hand, embrace the affective fallacy (what reader-response critic Stanley Fish has called the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affective fallacy fallacy</a><span class="glossdef">Term coined by Stanley Fish to express reader-response critics’ rejection of the New Critics’ affective fallacy. Reader-response critics believe that we should not repress our personal responses to literature but rather explore them in our writing.</span></span>”), for they believe that a reader’s affective response is importance to criticism.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_007">Stanley Fish, <em class="emphasis">Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost</em>, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).</span> Instead of focusing on literature as a well-wrought urn, reader-response critics focus on the reader, who “completes” or “activates” the text as he or she reads. In a sense, the reader becomes the most important element in the reading process, supplanting even the author.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p07">When you think about it, reader-response criticism makes perfect sense. How many times have you become so immersed in a work that you are oblivious to the world around you? If you like fantasy literature, you might still recall the first time you read the Harry Potter series—you were transported out of your Muggle world into the magical Hogwarts, where Harry and his friends battle the dark forces of the one we should not name. How many of you stood in line to get your copy of the latest Harry Potter novel at midnight? Or camped out at the theater to be one of the first to see the final installment of <em class="emphasis">The Deathly Hallows</em>? There may even be a few of you who are not Potter fans, but be warned—don’t share those thoughts too readily! A case point: one of the editors of this textbook, John Pennington, found this out quite clearly. He teaches a general-education course called Science Fiction and Fantasy, which attracts die-hard fans of these popular forms of fiction. When the first volume of the Harry Potter series came out, he was approached by a student, who told him that this was the best fantasy literature since J. R. R. Tolkien, maybe even better. Quite a claim, and one that came from a very intelligent student who clearly was excited about <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>! However, Pennington found that he did not enjoy the novel as much as his student had. So he read the next volume, and the next, and…you get the picture. To put it bluntly, he wasn’t that impressed with the Harry Potter series. He eventually published an article in <em class="emphasis">The Lion and the Unicorn</em>, a critical journal that focuses on children’s literature. In that article, he critiques the Harry Potter series as ineffective—shall we say, “failed”—fantasy literature.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_008">John Pennington, “From Elfland to Hogwarts, or the Aesthetic Trouble with Harry Potter,” <em class="emphasis">The Lion and the Unicorn</em> 26, no. 1 (2002): 78–97, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/toc/uni26.1.html">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/toc/uni26.1.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p08">Over the years, he has received emails from students who are doing research papers on Harry Potter. To demonstrate that literature is often read with passion, read the following e-mail to John Pennington, which he received from a student who was doing such a research paper:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p09">Hello, Professor Pennington. My name is Emily. I'm a senior English major at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, TX.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p10">For my honors thesis, I have been doing research on fantasy literature (I’m making a comparison of magical and fantastic creatures in American and British literature) and in my search, I stumbled across your piece “From Elfland to Hogwarts, or the Aesthetic Trouble with Harry Potter.” I won’t lie to you, I am an avid Harry Potter fan. I am the president of the St. Mary’s Harry Potter club, called Dumbledore’s Army.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p11">Mary’s Harry Potter club, called Dumbledore’s Army.
		I was just wondering if your feelings about certain aspects of the Harry Potter series have changed now that all the books have been released? I definitely agreed with some of your opinions and arguments (even as a little girl reading the books I made the connection between Tolkien/Rowling and Lewis/Rowling), but there are also instances in which I feel you were being too harsh. For instance, you said that while Voldemort was clearly the representation of the archetype for evil, there was none for good. I disagree. I don't believe that the figure for good needs to be a person or being at all. Instead, in the case of the Harry Potter, the symbol of the good archetype is love. Although, arguably, good and love could be seen as synonyms in some cases (through the right analytic lens), I think that love’s manifestations in the Harry Potter series are what truly combats Voldemort (rather than Harry’s attempts at battle—another aspect I, and indeed Harry, agree with you on: all he had was luck) and therefore become the figure of good.

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p50">I did find your piece helpful for my research and I do plan to read more of your published works in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p51">One other question: Do you often get e-mails from people who are disgruntled by your criticism of the Potter series? I would imagine the answer is yes.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s02_p14">One should not do battle with Dumbledore’s Army! In a follow-up email, where John admited to Emily that his critical views of Harry Potter had not really changed, he also added that he was a little disappointed that Rowling had indicated in an interview about her first novel for adults—The Casual Vacancy (2012)—that she didn’t see herself as a role model for children. Emily responded: “If it hadn’t been for getting a copy of The Sorcerer’s Stone in the 3rd grade, I may not be an English major now. I think a lot of the English majors of my generation are proof that she is a role model for children. Also, I think she must be intentionally ignoring the fact that there is a Harry Potter amusement park…how could kids not adore her?” Emily and John, interestingly, were acting as both critic and fan (or nonfan in John’s case). In other words, readers are to a degree torn between the role of being an objective critic and a subjective fan, a tension that reader-response theory can help explain. Some publishers, in fact, concentrate on critical works on Harry Potter, creating a critical industry that extolls the virtues of the Harry Potter series. Winged Lion/Zossima Press is just one example, and the titles highlight how scholarly investigation becomes fused with personal enthusiasm for the books.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.3</span> Focus on Reader-Response Strategies</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_p01">Reader-response strategies can be categorized, according to Richard Beach in <em class="emphasis">A Teacher’s Introduction to Reader-Response Theories</em> (1993), into five types: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">textual</a><span class="glossdef">Critical approach that emphasizes the text itself (relative to other forms of reader-response criticism); the text directs interpretation as the reader directs the text to interpretation.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">experiential</a><span class="glossdef">Form of criticism that emphasizes the reader’s reading process over the text; it involves analyzing our subjective responses to literature.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychological</a><span class="glossdef">Approach that explores how we connect to texts on a personal level.

    <div class="section" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Textual Reader-Response Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p01">Performing a close reading of a text teaches you to look “closely” at the way a text operates and to glean some meaning from the workings of the text. In other words, your interpretation is primarily directed by the text. Textual reader-response approaches admit to the fact that the text does influence the way readers read and construct meaning. Thus the reader and text interact in the process of formulating a meaning of the text. Imagine a text as a painting in an art gallery: your interpretation of the painting will be based on whether you like it or not, but this reaction will be directed by the painting itself. Or consider a literary text as a musical composition; as a listener, you are moved by the music, but you must relate the music to some experience to make it work emotionally on you. Another metaphor: a text is like an unfinished sculpture; the reader must bring the finished form to the work. Thus to textual reader-response critics, the text directs interpretation as the reader directs the text to interpretation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Literature as Transaction: Gap Filling and Ghost Chapters</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p01">A pioneer in reader-response criticism is Louise Rosenblatt, whose <em class="emphasis">Literature as Exploration</em> (5th ed., 1995) provided an alternative theory to the persistent New Critical approaches that gained such popularity. Rosenblatt contends that literature must become personal for it to have its full impact on the reader;<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_010">Louise Rosenblatt, <em class="emphasis">Literature as Exploration</em>, 5th ed. (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995).</span> in fact, New Criticism’s affective fallacy prevents the reader from engaging the text on any personal level. Rosenblatt’s approach, like the New Critical reading methods, provides a classroom strategy; however, whereas the New Critics centered on the literary text, Rosenblatt centers on the reader.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p02">Rosenblatt believes readers transact with the text by bringing in their past life experiences to help interpret the text.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_011">Louise Rosenblatt, <em class="emphasis">Literature as Exploration</em>, 5th ed. (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995).</span> Reading literature becomes an event—the reader activates the work through reading. Rosenblatt argues that any literary text allows for an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">efferent reading</a><span class="glossdef">What the reader believes he or she should retain after reading a text.</span></span>, which is what the reader believes should be retained after the reading; the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aesthetic reading</a><span class="glossdef">What the reader actually experiences while reading a text (in contrast to the efferent reading).</span></span>, on the other hand, is what the reader experiences while reading.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_012">Louise Rosenblatt, <em class="emphasis">Literature as Exploration</em>, 5th ed. (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995).</span> The aesthetic reading accounts for the changes in a reader’s attitude toward a literary work. Rosenblatt’s theory provides for a process of reading that leads to discussion and interpretation: a reader transacts with a literary text during the reading process, focusing on the aesthetic response while reading. After reading, then, the reader reflects on the aesthetic response and compares it to the textual evidence and other interpretations. In a way, literary interpretation is more focused on the transaction—the process of reading—than on an interpretation of a particular work.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p03">Another important reader-response theorist is Wolfgang Iser, who complements Rosenblatt. Iser believes that a literary work has meaning once a reader engages in the text.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_013">Wolfgang Iser, <em class="emphasis">The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Text</em>, (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1979).</span> According to Iser, every literary work is balanced by two poles, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">artistic</a><span class="glossdef">What the author creates; a literary work is caught between this and the esthetic pole.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">esthetic poles</a><span class="glossdef">That which is realized or completed by the reader; a literary work is caught between this and the artistic pole.</span></span>, roughly corresponding to Rosenblatt’s efferent and aesthetic readings. For Iser, the artistic pole is that created by the author; the esthetic pole is that realized or completed by the reader.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_014">Wolfgang Iser, <em class="emphasis">The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Text</em>, (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1979).</span> Since a literary work is caught between these two poles, its meaning resides in the gap between these poles; the primary quality of a text is its indeterminacy. A textual critic, Iser recognizes that the text—the artistic pole—guides the reader who resides in the esthetic pole. He distinguishes between the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implied reader</a><span class="glossdef">The reader a text creates for itself—the hypothetical person the work seems to address.</span></span>, one the text creates for itself, and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">actual reader</a><span class="glossdef">The real person who reads the literary work; he or she may not resemble the text’s implied reader.</span></span>, the reader who brings “things” to the text.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_015">Wolfgang Iser, <em class="emphasis">The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Text</em>, (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1979).</span> Consequently, there exists a gap between the implied and actual reader, and between the artistic and esthetic poles. The reader, then, must perform gap filling to concretize the text. Umberto Eco, another reader-response critic, takes gap filling even further, arguing that readers write ghost chapters for texts as a way to understand the transaction that happens between the text and reader.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_016">Umberto Eco, “The Reading Process: A Phenomenological Approach.” in <em class="emphasis">Reader-Response Criticism from Formalism to Post-Structuralism</em>. ed by Jane P. Tompkins. (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980) pgs. 50–69.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p04">As you can see, Iser’s textual reader-response criticism is based on his contention that the reader concretizes the text—gives it meaning—while the text necessarily guides this concretization. Consequently, a literary text operates by indeterminacy; it has gaps that the reader attempts to fill.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Transaction: The Rhetoric of Fiction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p01">Another pioneer in reader-response criticism is Wayne Booth, who in <em class="emphasis">The Rhetoric of Fiction</em> (1961; revised edition 1983) analyzes the way literature engages us through its language, or rhetoric.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_017">Wayne Booth, <em class="emphasis">The Rhetoric of Fiction</em>, 2nd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983).</span> Booth shows readers how authors manipulate them into seeing things they have never seen before. Booth’s most important contributions to reader-response criticism (and literary criticism in general) are his concepts of the implied author (or narrator) and the unreliable narrator, and how these force us to confront reading as an ethical act.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implied author</a><span class="glossdef">The narrative voice an author creates in his or her work. The implied author guides or directs the reader’s interpretation of the text.</span></span>—the narrative voice the author creates in a work—is the most important artistic effect: in a sense, the implied author directs the reader’s reaction to the literary work, guiding—or sometimes forcing—the reader to react on an emotional level since the implied author brings his or her ethical principles to the text. By directing the reader’s interpretation, the implied author limits the reader’s response while forcing the reader to react to the implied author.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p03">For example, Booth contends that the implied author in <em class="emphasis">Emma</em> recognizes that the reader must be able to empathize and like Emma; if not, the novel will fail.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_018">Wayne Booth, <em class="emphasis">The Rhetoric of Fiction</em>, 2nd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983).</span> Thus Austen creates an implied author—the narrator—who controls our perception of Emma by creating a character the reader can empathize with, laugh at when appropriate, and condemn when needed. Since the implied author becomes like a friend and guide, we as readers can rely on the narrative voice to guide us.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p04">Booth recognizes that while a text’s implied author may be reliable, the work may still have an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unreliable narrator</a><span class="glossdef">A narrator that cannot be trusted because he or she has a limited viewpoint (often this is a first-person narrator). An unreliable narrator forces the reader to respond to the text on a moral plane.</span></span>. The narrator in Jonathan Swift’s “Modest Proposal” seems perfectly reliable and in control until we realize that his proposal to alleviate the poverty of the Ireland is to raise babies as edible delicacies!<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_019">Jonathan Swift, “Modest Proposal” (London: 1729; University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center, 2004), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/SwiMode.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/SwiMode.html</a>.</span> Or think of the first-person narrators of Mark Twain’s <em class="emphasis">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1885) or J. D. Salinger’s <em class="emphasis">The Catcher in the Rye</em> (1951).<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_020">J. D. Salinger, <em class="emphasis">The Catcher in the Rye</em> (London: Little, Brown, 1951).</span> An unreliable narrator requires the author and reader to engage in a special bond whereby they acknowledge that the narrator cannot be trusted; in a way, then, the reader and author engage in a transaction by recognizing the limited view of the unreliable implied author. The unreliable narrator, ultimately, forces the reader to respond on some moral plane.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p05">By appealing to the moral qualities of the reader, Booth provides a framework for an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethics of reading</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that a reader must carefully judge the ethical dimension to a work, comparing his or her personal experience and moral beliefs with the narrative.</span></span> that he defines in <em class="emphasis">The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction</em> (1988). Using Rosenblatt’s distinction between the efferent and aesthetic reading, Booth argues that the reader must carry over the efferent reading into the aesthetic, for the efferent reading requires us to compare our personal experience and moral beliefs with the narrative.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_021">Wayne Booth, <em class="emphasis">The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988).</span> Since a literary work takes us over for the duration of the reading experience, an ethics of reading will require the reader to eventually judge the ethical dimension to a work. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonce beliefs</a><span class="glossdef">The beliefs the narrator and reader share only during the reading of the text (in contrast to fixed norms).</span></span> are the beliefs the narrator and reader embrace only during the reading. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fixed norms</a><span class="glossdef">The beliefs upon which a literary work depends. Unlike nonce beliefs, these are applicable to the real world outside the text.</span></span> are the beliefs on which the entire literary work depends for effect but also are applicable to the real world. As an example, Booth uses Aesop’s fables, for a talking animal relates to our nonce beliefs—the talking animal is acknowledged as essential to the narrative—when the fixed norms will entail the moral that concludes the fable. Thus the nonce and fixed beliefs require a transaction between reader and work. Booth suggests that an ethics of reading becomes a two-stage process: (1) the reader must surrender fully to the reading experience and then (2) the reader must contemplate the reading experience from an ethical perspective (which depends on the reader’s own moral stance).<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_022">Wayne Booth, <em class="emphasis">The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988).</span> In other words, we should keep company with the literary work and maintain an open mind until we conclude that the work might be harmful to us—or be in conflict with our moral beliefs. As you can see, Booth’s ethics of reading is determined by the reader’s moral makeup, which is dependent on a specific time and reading experience. It is open to change.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p06">Kate Chopin’s “The Storm” (1898) is a good example of this.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_023">“Kate Chopin ‘The Storm,’” The Kate Chopin International Society, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.katechopin.org/the-storm.shtml">http://www.katechopin.org/the-storm.shtml</a>.</span> In the story, a married woman has a passionate affair one afternoon with an acquaintance who by chance comes to her house to escape a storm. Their relationship is set up in an earlier story, “At the Cadian Ball” (1892), Chopin presents the affair as a natural impulse; the ending of the story tells us that both parties are happy and content.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_024">Kate Chopin, “At the ’Cadian Ball,” in <em class="emphasis">The Awakening, and Selected Stories</em>, ed. Sandra M. Gilbert (New York: Penguin, 1984).</span> While in the company of “The Storm,” you will respond to the story itself as it occupies you, yet after your reading you will complete the reading by bringing your ethics into play: do you reject the story because it does not condemn adultery? Do you embrace the story because of its honest depiction of sexual passion?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p07">Booth’s brand of textual reader-response criticism is a valuable tool for readers since he provides a textual model of reading—the implied author who is reliable and unreliable—that embraces the ethical dimension of the reader, who must transact with the literary work.</p>

            <li>Readers surrender themselves to the text, letting the text wash over them; in fact, at this stage, readers should not be concerned with trying to understand what the work is about.</li>
            <li>Readers next concentrate on their reading responses while reading, seeing how each word, each sentence, each paragraph elicits a response.</li>
            <li>Finally, readers should describe the reading experience by structuring their reading responses, which may be in conflict with the common interpretation of a work.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_027">Stanley Fish, <em class="emphasis">Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost</em>, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p02">Fish’s thesis is seductive, for when we read, we are constantly reacting to our reading, connecting it to our personal lives, to other literary works we have read, and to our reading experience at that particular reading moment. Sometimes we will love to read; other times we dread it. In <em class="emphasis">Surprised by Sin</em>, Fish examines how the reader is affected by a reading of John Milton’s <em class="emphasis">Paradise Lost</em> (1667), that epic poem that describes the fall of Adam and Eve.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_028">John Milton, <em class="emphasis">Paradise Lost</em> (1667; University of Virginia Electronic Text Center, 1993), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MilPL67.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MilPL67.html</a>.</span> Fish argues that the reading experience of <em class="emphasis">Paradise Lost</em> mirrors the actual Fall of Adam and Eve from the Garden.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_029">Stanley Fish, <em class="emphasis">Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost</em>, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p03">As intriguing as Fish’s affective stylistics may be, the reality is that readers often agree on meaning; that is, they tend to see similar things in the same text. A textual reader-response critic would argue that the text—through its transaction with the reader—leads to such common interpretation, but Fish is interested in another possibility—that we are trained to find similar meanings. He calls this idea <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interpretive communities</a><span class="glossdef">A group of readers who share common beliefs that cause them to read a text in a similar way. For example, feminist critics are trained to identify and analyze gender issues, so it’s likely that two feminist critics who read the same text will have similar interpretations.</span></span>. To Fish, then, a reader of an interpretive community brings a meaning <em class="emphasis">to</em> the text because he or she is trained to.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_030">Stanley Fish, <em class="emphasis">Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost</em>, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).</span> A student in a modernist poetry class, for example, would interpret Wallace Stevens’s “Anecdote of the Jar” in terms of modernism and the poetic movements in modernism and be at ease making claims about the poem’s meaning. Literary theory, which you are learning as you work your way through this text, also demonstrates the interpretive community. If you are intrigued by Freudian psychoanalytic criticism, you will find Freudian meanings in the works that you are reading; likewise, a feminist critic will find gender issues when reading. Another way to understand interpretive communities is to note that the American legal system has embraced the idea of interpretive communities in jury selection: for example, if a defense attorney who is representing a college student in an underage drinking case can get members on the jury who agree that the drinking age should be lowered to nineteen, then the jury may have already interpreted the evidence in light of their beliefs and will find the student not guilty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p04">Experiential reader response acknowledges that reading is a subjective process and attempts to understand how to analyze such subjective responses.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p01">When we read, we are continually connecting the text to our lives, almost as if the literary work is speaking to us personally. Psychological reader response helps us better understand this phenomenon.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_p01">Often called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subjective criticism</a><span class="glossdef">A form of reader-response criticism that views a literary work as comprising both the concrete text and our interpretation of it. The text’s meaning is ultimately created when readers compare their responses with each other to develop a communal interpretation.</span></span>, this form of reader-response criticism is championed by David Bleich, who believes that a reader’s response becomes the text itself, ripe for analysis (or psychoanalysis). To Bleich, a literary text comprises a real entity—the text, the words on the page, which is a concrete object—and our interpretation of the concrete text, which can be seen as a symbolic object. We “resymbolize” the text through our perceptions and beliefs. Meaning, then, is negotiated: our reading response (highly personal) is often brought to a larger body (communal) to discuss the meaning of a piece of literature. The classroom is a perfect example: you are assigned to read something, you read it and develop a personal interpretation, and then you share that interpretation with the class; ultimately, the class creates a more communal interpretation. In subjective criticism, knowledge is seen as socially constructed from the interaction of all readers; thus, interpretation is seen as personal, yet communal, the common element being that reading is subjective. The transaction that happens in subjective criticism is between the personal reader-oriented response statement and the more public-oriented response statement, which reflects the themes in the text.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Identity Analysis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p01">Norman Holland’s approach to reader response follows in the footsteps of subjective criticism. According to Holland, people deal with texts the same way they deal with life. Holland would say that we gravitate toward particular literary works because they speak to our inner—our psychological—needs. In other words, each reader has an identity that we can analyze, which will open up the literary text to personal interpretation based on a reader’s identity. Thus we use the term “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">identity analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A form of psychological reader-response criticism; it posits that we are drawn to literary works that speak to our psychological needs—and, conversely, we are repelled or troubled by works that do not meet our needs.</span></span>” to describe the form of psychological reader-response criticism that suggests that we are drawn to literary works that speak to our psychological needs—conversely, we are repelled or troubled by works that do not meet our needs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p02">These identity needs are often repressed in the unconscious and are in need of an outlet, which is provided by reading. When reading, then, we can engage our repressed desires or needs. Why do we read fantasy literature? Romance literature? Thrillers? Self-help books? Science fiction? Reading becomes a personal way to cope with life.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p03">This coping process is interpretation, for literature exposes more about the reader than about the text itself. Holland believes that each reader has an “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">identity theme</a><span class="glossdef">Within identity analysis, the particular pattern of defense that a reader brings to a text. A reader who belongs to a marginalized racial or ethnic group, for example, is likely to have a different set of literary likes, dislikes, and defenses than a reader who belongs to the dominant racial or ethnic group in a society.</span></span>,” a pattern of defense that he or she brings to a text. In turn, we gravitate to texts that tend to reinforce our identity themes and our needs. The contrary is also true: we will avoid texts that challenge our identity or threaten our psychological needs. When we read a text, we see ourselves reflected back at us. Holland calls this transactional process <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">DEFT</a><span class="glossdef">Critic Norman Holland’s process for reading a text, which involves <strong class="emphasis bold">d</strong>efense, <strong class="emphasis bold">e</strong>xpectation, <strong class="emphasis bold">f</strong>antasy, and <strong class="emphasis bold">t</strong>ransformation.</span></span>: we read in <strong class="emphasis bold">d</strong>efense (a coping strategy that aligns with our <strong class="emphasis bold">e</strong>xpectations) that leads to <strong class="emphasis bold">f</strong>antasy (our ability to find gratification) and finally to <strong class="emphasis bold">t</strong>ransformation (that leads to a total unifying effect for the reader).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s04_p01">Often referred to as “reception theory,” social reader response is interested in how a literary work is received over time. In fact, the status of a literary work is dependent on the reader’s reception of the work. Hans Robert Jauss, a key figure in “reception theory,” argues that the history of the reader is as important as the history of the literary work; in fact, the reader’s evolving interpretation is at the heart of the changing literary status.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_032">Hans Robert Jauss, <em class="emphasis">Toward an Aesthetic Reception</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s04_p02">A classic example from nineteenth-century American literature is <em class="emphasis">Moby-Dick</em> (1851), now considered one of the greatest—if not the greatest—American novel ever written.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_033">Herman Melville, <em class="emphasis">Moby-Dick, or, The Whale</em> (1952; University of Virginia Electronic Text Center, 1993), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/Mel2Mob.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/Mel2Mob.html</a>.</span> Andrew Delbanco titles the first chapter of his book <em class="emphasis">Required Reading: Why Our American Classics Matter Now</em> (1997) “Melville’s Sacramental Style,” which brings an almost religious fervor to the importance of Melville generally and <em class="emphasis">Moby-Dick</em> specifically.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_034">Andrew Delbanco, <em class="emphasis">Required Reading: Why Our American Classics Matter Now</em> (New York: Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 1997).</span> But this has not always been the case.

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s04_p08">Why the change in reputation? Critics started reassessing <em class="emphasis">Moby-Dick</em>, scholars tell us, in 1919, and by 1930 the novel was frequently taught in college classrooms, thus cementing its critical reputation. In 1941 F. O. Mathiessen, in <em class="emphasis">American Renaissance</em>, placed Melville as a central writer in the nineteenth century.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_036">F. O.

The romantic Janie, in the highly-charged language of Miss Hurston, longed to be a pear tree in blossom and have a “dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace.” Restless, she fled from her farmer husband and married Jody, an up-and-coming Negro business man who, in the end, proved to be no better than her first husband. After twenty years of clerking for her self-made Jody, Janie found herself a frustrated widow of forty with a small fortune on her hands. Tea Cake, “from in and through Georgia,” drifted along and, despite his youth, Janie took him. For more than two years they lived happily; but Tea Cake was bitten by a mad dog and was infected with rabies.

        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s05_p01">Cultural reader response acknowledges that readers will bring their personal background to the reading of a text. What is that background? A variety of markers, including gender, race, sexual orientation, even political affiliation compose someone’s background. In other words, as readers we may interpret a literary work in light of where we are situated in society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s03_s05_p02">For example, gender is key to the way that readers respond to a literary work.

        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p05">Such a chart, of course, suggests that one category is privileged over another: reason over emotion, good over evil, light over darkness, active over passive, strong over weak, and husband over wife. In other words, men over women. And Amy realized that the humor in Thurber’s essay results because he inverts these binaries, because Mrs. Mitty becomes a stereotypical nagging wife and seems to take on the active male role, while Walter becomes passive, more in line with another stereotype that is placed upon a woman. Now Amy was in a bind: as a female reader, how was she to find humor in such stereotypes of men and women?</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p06">Amy’s paper blends textual and cultural reader-response theory—the use of gap filling with the notion that gender influences reading strategies.

            <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p07">It is certain that women misread “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.” I did. I found myself initially wishing that Mrs. Mitty would just let Walter daydream in peace. But after reading the story again and paying attention to the portrayal of Mrs. Mitty, I realized that it is imperative that women rebel against the texts that would oppress them. By misreading a text, the woman reader understands it in a way that is conventional and acceptable to the literary world. But in so doing, she is also distancing herself from the text, not fully embracing it or its meaning in her life. By rebelling against the text, the female reader not only has to understand the point of view of the author and the male audience, but she also has to formulate her own opinions and create a sort of dialogue between the text and herself. Rebelling against the text and the stereotypes encourages an active dialogue between the woman and the text which, in turn, guarantees an active and (most likely) angry reader response. I became a resisting reader.</p>

        <p class="simpara">To Misread or to Rebel: A Woman’s Reading of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p15">At its simplest, reading is “an activity that is guided by the text; this must be processed by the reader who is then, in turn, affected by what he has processed” (Iser 63). The text is the compass and map, the reader is the explorer. However, the explorer cannot disregard those unexpected boulders in the path which he or she encounters along the journey that are not written on the map. Likewise, the woman reader does not come to the text without outside influences. She comes with her experiences as a woman—a professional woman, a divorcée, a single mother. Her reading, then, is influenced by her experiences. So when she reads a piece of literature like “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” by James Thurber, which paints a highly negative picture of Mitty’s wife, the woman reader is forced to either misread the story and accept Mrs. Mitty as a domineering, mothering wife, or rebel against that picture and become angry at the society which sees her that way.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p16">Due to pre-existing sociosexual standards, women see characters, family structures, even societal structures from the bottom as an oppressed group rather than from a powerful position on the top, as men do. As Louise Rosenblatt states: a reader’s “tendency toward identification [with characters or events] will certainly be guided by our preoccupations at the time we read. Our problems and needs may lead us to focus on those characters and situations through which we may achieve the satisfactions, the balanced vision, or perhaps merely the unequivocal motives unattained in our own lives” (38). A woman reader who feels chained by her role as a housewife is more likely to identify with an individual who is oppressed or feels trapped than the reader’s executive husband is. Likewise, a woman who is unable to have children might respond to a story of a child’s death more emotionally than a woman who does not want children. However, if the perspective of a woman does not match that of the male author whose work she is reading, a woman reader who has been shaped by a male-dominated society is forced to misread the text, reacting to the “words on the page in one way rather than another because she operates according to the same set of rules that the author used to generate them” (Tompkins xvii). By accepting the author’s perspective and reading the text as he intended, the woman reader is forced to disregard her own, female perspective. This, in turn, leads to a concept called “asymmetrical contingency,” described by Iser as that which occurs “when Partner A gives up trying to implement his own behavioral plan and without resistance follows that of Partner B. He adapts himself to and is absorbed by the behavioral strategy of B” (164). Using this argument, it becomes clear that a woman reader (Partner A) when faced with a text written by a man (Partner B) will most likely succumb to the perspective of the writer and she is thus forced to misread the text. Or, she could rebel against the text and raise an angry, feminist voice in protest.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p17">James Thurber, in the eyes of most literary critics, is one of the foremost American humorists of the 20th century, and his short story “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” is believed to have “ushered in a major [literary] period … where the individual can maintain his self … an appropriate way of assaulting rigid forms” (Elias 432). The rigid form in Thurber’s story is Mrs. Mitty, the main character’s wife. She is portrayed by Walter Mitty as a horrible, mothering nag. As a way of escaping her constant griping, he imagines fantastic daydreams which carry him away from Mrs. Mitty’s voice. Yet she repeatedly interrupts his reveries and Mitty responds to her as though she is “grossly unfamiliar, like a strange woman who had yelled at him in the crowd” (286). Not only is his wife annoying to him, but she is also distant and removed from what he cares about, like a stranger. When she does speak to him, it seems reflective of the way a mother would speak to a child. For example, Mrs. Mitty asks, “‘Why don’t you wear your gloves? Have you lost your gloves?’ Walter Mitty reached in a pocket and brought out the gloves. He put them on, but after she had turned and gone into the building and he had driven on to a red light, he took them off again” (286). Mrs. Mitty’s care for her husband’s health is seen as nagging to Walter Mitty, and the audience is amused that he responds like a child and does the opposite of what Mrs. Mitty asked of him. Finally, the clearest way in which Mrs. Mitty is portrayed as a burdensome wife is at the end of the piece when Walter, waiting for his wife to exit the store, imagines that he is facing “the firing squad; erect and motionless, proud and disdainful, Walter Mitty the Undefeated, inscrutable to the last” (289). Not only is Mrs. Mitty portrayed as a mothering, bothersome hen, but she is ultimately described as that which will be the death of Walter Mitty.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p18">Mrs. Mitty is a direct literary descendant of the first woman to be stereotyped as a nagging wife, Dame Van Winkle, the creation of the American writer, Washington Irving. Likewise, Walter Mitty is a reflection of his dreaming predecessor, Rip Van Winkle, who falls into a deep sleep for a hundred years and awakes to the relief of finding out that his nagging wife has died. Judith Fetterley explains in her book, The Resisting Reader, how such a portrayal of women forces a woman who reads “Rip Van Winkle” and other such stories “to find herself excluded from the experience of the story” so that she “cannot read the story without being assaulted by the negative images of women it presents” (10). The result, it seems, is for a woman reader of a story like “Rip Van Winkle” or “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” to either be excluded from the text, or accept the negative images of women the story puts forth. As Fetterley points out, “The consequence for the female reader is a divided self. She is asked to identify with Rip and against herself, to scorn the amiable sex and act just like it, to laugh at Dame Van Winkle and accept that she represents ‘woman,’ to be at once both repressor and repressed, and ultimately to realize that she is neither” (11). Thus, a woman is forced to misread the text and accept “woman as villain.” as Fetterley names it, or rebel against both the story and its message.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p19">So how does a woman reader respond to this portrayal of Mrs. Mitty? If she were to follow Iser’s claim, she would defer to the male point of view presented by the author. She would sympathize with Mitty, as Thurber wants us to do, and see domineering women in her own life that resemble Mrs. Mitty. She may see her mother and remember all the times that she nagged her about zipping up her coat against the bitter winter wind. Or the female reader might identify Mrs. Mitty with her controlling mother-in-law and chuckle at Mitty’s attempts to escape her control, just as her husband tries to escape the criticism and control of his own mother. Iser’s ideal female reader would undoubtedly look at her own position as mother and wife and would vow to never become such a domineering person. This reader would probably also agree with a critic who says that “Mitty has a wife who embodies the authority of a society in which the husband cannot function” (Lindner 440). She could see the faults in a relationship that is too controlled by a woman and recognize that a man needs to feel important and dominant in his relationship with his wife. It could be said that the female reader would agree completely with Thurber’s portrayal of the domineering wife. The female reader could simply misread the text.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p20">Or, the female reader could rebel against the text. She could see Mrs. Mitty as a woman who is trying to do her best to keep her husband well and cared for. She could see Walter as a man with a fleeting grip on reality who daydreams that he is a fighter pilot, a brilliant surgeon, a gun expert, or a military hero, when he actually is a poor driver with a slow reaction time to a green traffic light. The female reader could read critics of Thurber who say that by allowing his wife to dominate him, Mitty becomes a “non-hero in a civilization in which women are winning the battle of the sexes” (Hasley 533) and become angry that a woman’s fight for equality is seen merely as a battle between the sexes. She could read Walter’s daydreams as his attempt to dominate his wife, since all of his fantasies center on him in traditional roles of power. This, for most women, would cause anger at Mitty (and indirectly Thurber) for creating and promoting a society which believes that women need to stay subservient to men. From a male point of view, it becomes a battle of the sexes. In a woman’s eyes, her reading is simply a struggle for equality within the text and in the world outside that the text reflects.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s05_p21">It is certain that women misread “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.” I did. I found myself initially wishing that Mrs. Mitty would just let Walter daydream in peace. But after reading the story again and paying attention to the portrayal of Mrs. Mitty, I realized that it is imperative that women rebel against the texts that would oppress them. By misreading a text, the woman reader understands it in a way that is conventional and acceptable to the literary world. But in so doing, she is also distancing herself from the text, not fully embracing it or its meaning in her life. By rebelling against the text, the female reader not only has to understand the point of view of the author and the male audience, but she also has to formulate her own opinions and create a sort of dialogue between the text and herself. Rebelling against the text and the stereotypes encourages an active dialogue between the woman and the text which, in turn, guarantees an active and (most likely) angry reader response. I became a resisting reader.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.6</span> Student Sample Paper: Hannah Schmitt’s “The Death of Intellectualism in Grahame-Smith and Austen’s <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>”</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p01">This chapter begins with an example from Jane Austen’s <em class="emphasis">Emma</em>. Austen has become a cultural commodity—that is, she is continually updated and revised to make her relevant to our society. On the one hand, there are the serious scholars of Austen, who analyze her work as central to the key canon of literature. On the other hand, there exists the Janeites, who are the ultimate fans of the novelist, groupies so to speak.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p02">This tension leads to interesting updates. The 1995 movie <em class="emphasis">Clueless</em>, for example, is an updating of <em class="emphasis">Emma</em>, centering the courtship dynamics in a high school. <em class="emphasis">Lost in Austen</em>, a 2008 television series, is a kind of time-swapping story where a young Londoner of the twenty-first century changes roles with Elizabeth Bennet from <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813).<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_050">Jane Austen, <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813; Project Gutenberg, 2008), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm</a>.</span> Karen Joy Fowler’s novel <em class="emphasis">The Jane Austen Book Club</em> (2004) concerns a book club that meets to discuss Austen; it was made into a popular movie in 2007.<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn06_051">Karen Joy Fowler, <em class="emphasis">The Jane Austen Book Club</em> (New York: Penguin, 2004).</span></p>

        <p class="simpara">The Death of Intellectualism in Grahame-Smith and Austen’s <em class="emphasis bolditalic">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p08">“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains” (Austen and Grahame-Smith 7). So begins <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, the surprise <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> Best Seller mashup by Seth Grahame-Smith, in which the characters of Austen’s <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> are faced with an imminent zombie apocalypse. When <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> was first released in 2009, it marked the beginning of a slew of literary mashups. However, despite Quirk Classic’s best efforts, none of its subsequent works matched the popularity of the Austen mashup, which has since been made into a graphic novel and an iPhone game. Interestingly, when <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> is re-imagined, even its re-imagined counterpart meets with more success than other literary mashups. The sheer replicability of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> suggests that its appeal extends far beyond a frivolous spoof and touches some cultural nerve. At its heart, <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> attempts to grapple with contemporary fears of the death of intellectualism.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p09">In recent years, critics have thought of a number of theories to explain the newfound interest in zombies which dominates popular culture, and our society’s interest in zombies has been attributed to everything from “the global financial crisis” (Hall 1) to “a fascination, paranoia and socio-politico-cultural movement of war” (Sulter-Cohen 183). In her article “The Living Dead? Construction of People with Alzheimer’s as Zombies,” Susan M. Behuniak draws attention to the damaging cultural trend of comparing zombies with individuals who have Alzheimer’s, triggering “emotional responses of disgust and utter terror” towards patients (72). Though Behuniak specifically states in her article that she wishes to dissect rather than encourage the connection between zombies and persons with Alzheimer’s (71–72), I think the cultural tendency to link them hints that zombies, to at least some extent, tap into our culture’s fears about intellectual loss.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p10">Our society is obsessed with the possible failures of its own education system, and struggles with not only education legislation but also misgivings about the educational appropriacy of newer forms of technology such as texting, video gaming, and prolonged Internet exposure. The Bush administration’s controversial education reform act, No Child Left Behind, has given way to a slew of texts such as Jonathan Kozol’s <em class="emphasis">The Shame of the Nation</em>, Diane Ravitch’s <em class="emphasis">The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools</em>, edited by Deborah Meier and George Wood, which herald the approaching end of creative intellect and the failure of the education system in the United States. Conservative educational critics, such as John Stossel in his special “Stupid in America,” blame perceived educational shortcomings of the United States on bureaucracy of the public school system and teacher unions. Conservatives and liberals alike have agreed that the United States’ education system is inadequate, and our culture is regularly confronted with critics warning of the imminent failure of education.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p11">The success of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, then, comes from Grahame-Smith’s ability to recognize and respond to current cultural fears. Our society no longer fears sea monsters, and even traditionally villainous creatures such as vampires and werewolves have become fairly innocuous (or, at least, brooding and misunderstood), because our society has come to either embrace or deny the fears which created these creatures. If one views zombies as the embodiments of the death of intellect, then zombies remain potent because of their immediate cultural relevance.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p12">As Jane Austen’s most famous novel, <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> has defined our culture’s understanding of Regency-era literature and become virtually synonymous with cultured romance. However, the popularity of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> comes at the cost of sacrificing the nonromantic elements of her work, such as her focus on social status and satiric commentary on decorum. In her essay “Austen Therapy: <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> and Popular Culture,” Marilyn Francus argues that modern adaptions of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em>—particularly chick lit such as Shannon Hale’s <em class="emphasis">Austenland</em> and Alexandra Potter’s <em class="emphasis">Me and Mr. Darcy</em>—“perpetuate <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> as a pure romance narrative” and “reinforce <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em>’s power as a real, realizable narrative, rather than as a fictional one.” Audiences recognize characters such as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet but also reduce these characters to their broadest, most cliched sense, as models for romantic literature. Cultural re-imaginations of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> have established the prominence and recognizability of the text, but also remove <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> from its larger social context, thereby creating an atmosphere for <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> which encourages readers to distance the text from its nonromantic elements. <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> is recognizable enough that readers understand how the characters ought to act and popular enough that some audiences will accept adaptions and updating as continuations rather than affronts, making it ideal fodder for parody.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p13">The humor of this parody allows the Grahame-Smith to justify the “ultra-violent zombie mayhem” the book’s tagline promises. The violence of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> reflects the fear of ostracization and irrationality which may accompany the end of intellectualism. The intellectual void of the zombies in the novel is so potent that the only way the otherwise-rational main characters are able to defend themselves is through brute force. The violence of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> affects all of the characters, and becomes the only acceptable way to handle zombie attacks. In this sense, all the characters in <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> are affected by the zombie-creating plague, even if they are not directly afflicted. Because the “unmentionables” draw strength from their numbers, the sympathy of others, and the ease by which the infection is spread, the main characters must be merciless. Zombies, like the intellectual void they represent, are incapable of listening to reason. Furthermore, zombieism is transmitted through biting, which zombies do fairly frequently, and upon death, so virtually anyone can contract “the strange plague” (30). Any character can become a zombie at any time, and only violence can stop zombies.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p14">The violence created by the presence of zombies affects nearly all of the characters in the text. Mr. Bennet, who was reading a newspaper at the beginning of the original text, is now polishing his musket when Mrs. Bennet tells him of their new neighbor (7). Lady Catherine de Bourgh becomes a famous zombie slayer, and her house comes equipped with a dojo and ninjas (129). The five Bennet sisters—Jane included—flip-flop between their original personalities and their hardened, warrior personas. Even Mr. Bingley’s values change, as he notices that he has “never seen ladies so steady-handed in combat” (32). Because the threat of zombie is always-present, the characters change the way they relate in order to accommodate their chaotic lifestyle.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p15">Even when there are no zombies present, the characters’ methods of relating to each other change. Elizabeth signals her rejection of Mr. Darcy’s first proposal by physically attacking him (151), and at the end of the novel Lady Catherine challenges Elizabeth to a death match (289). When Mr. Darcy goes to London in search of Wickham after Lydia’s elopement, he beats Mrs. Younge into submission (259) and, after he finds Wickham, Darcy “render[s] him [Wickham] lame, as punishment for a lifetime of vice and betrayal” (260). Though presented comedically, the extreme amounts of violence in the characters need to use in order to vanquish their undead foes spills into other aspects of their lives, and the social discourse which marked all of the previously mentioned circumstances in the original <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em> become characterized by violence. The characters lose their abilities to talk through their problems and express their anger pacifistically, and, in the face of the constant danger of losing their logic, actually forfeit their ability to coexist peaceably.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p16">Of all the characters in the text, Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet undergo perhaps the least noticeable changes in character, perhaps because they already address the concerns raised by <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>. As a character who lacks intellectualism himself, Mr. Collins reminds readers of how the perception of intellect has changed since Austen’s time. Both Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins lack the violent urgency of the other characters in the text, and seem blithely unaware of the looming zombie apocalypse—indeed, Mr. Collins fails to notice when his own wife, who had been “stricken” just before their engagement (99), gradually devolves into a slobbering brain eater (120). Mrs. Bennet is far too concerned with the future marital happiness of her daughters to register the dangers of attending social events, when zombies are most inclined to launch their ill-conceived assaults. Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins represent a different kind of intellectual death—pettiness and self-obsessed conceit. However, the pomp of these characters, while recognizable to modern audiences, is not as totalizing as the anti-intellectualism of the zombies. Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins are still foolish, but even they possess some grain of sense. The “unmentionables” which populate the novel do not.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p17">Just as significant as the success of <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> is the relative failure of subsequent texts. While <em class="emphasis">Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters</em> made the New York Times Bestseller list after its release, it lacked the enthusiastic reception and cult classic-style popularity of its predecessor because, unlike <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, <em class="emphasis">Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters</em> did not tap into a cultural moment. Our society has no reason to fear or relate to sea monsters. The mashup genre depends on cultural context for its success.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s06_p18">Through its use of dark comedy, <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> both temporarily assuages its audience’s fears of the decline of intellectualism and subtly reminds readers that a society’s ability to cohere is directly related to its intellectual capacities. By taking characters who have become cultural staples because of their simplifications, Grahame-Smith creates a text which is at once highly recognizable and available for satire. The success of this novel directly hinges on its ability to recognize and reproduce cultural fears, allowing readers to achieve a catharsis.</p>

        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p06">When reading the same poem, two readers will ultimately come to different interpretations of which neither one is necessarily more correct than the other. Because of the inevitable variance of responses, some literary critics have abandoned the notion that an “objective” reading exists. Reader-response critics agree that all readings are “subjective” because they must be filtered through the reader. Each reader brings a unique background and approach to the work that he or she will read. In the words of Norman Holland, “As readers, each of us will bring different kinds of external information to bear. Each will seek out the particular themes that concern him. Each will have different ways of making the text into an experience with a coherence and significance that satisfies” (123). Critics, such as David Bleich, go so far as to say that “it is the reader who determines whether a piece of writing is literature” (1254). If it is assumed that the reader is essential to the distinction of a work as literature and each reader approaches the work differently, then how do we understand and evaluate different interpretations of a work.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p07">Norman Holland presents a strategy that correlates any interpretation to the individual personality of the reader: “<em class="emphasis">interpretation is a function of identity</em>” (123). When a reader interprets a text through his or her identity theme, he or she first fits the text closely to his or her way of adapting to difficult situation; he or she approaches the work as he or she would approach life. Secondly, the reader unconsciously associates the work to his or her desires and experiences. Lastly, the reader moves from the desires to significance where he or she can share and communicate a meaning with others (Holland 126–27). These steps are all taken in accordance with the person’s identity theme, the way he or she approaches life. Thus, an interpretation of a text can be analyzed and explained by understanding the reader’s approach to life, his or her identity theme.</p>
        <p class="simpara">The Project</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p08">My goal for this paper is to apply Holland’s theory of identity themes to particular readers and their interpretations. I will show that indeed each of the interpretations that I present are related to the reader’s approach to life. With the four interpretations that I collected, I will first give a brief profile of the reader and his or her approach to life followed by a generalization of this profile, which I see as the identity theme for this person. Secondly, I will relate, as was written by the reader, his or her interpretation, which is often in the form of scattered notes. When helpful, I will also relate the reader’s verbal comments, which usually show a judgment by the reader of his or her ability to interpret literature. Finally, I will explain the connection between the reader’s approach to life and his or her interpretation. As assumed by Holland’s theory, the following examples demonstrate a direct correlation between the reader’s identity theme and his or her interpretation.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p09">In order to give a full understanding of this project, I will present my methods for collecting the interpretation. First, I chose a poem by Emily Dickinson called “After Great Pain.” I printed copies of the poem without the author’s name on it. I then gave the poem to four readers, which I tried to pick from various academic fields. In addition, I know all of the readers personally; I found this necessary under the time restraint and my need to create a profile of the reader without developing an extensive process of getting to know the person. I asked the readers to write their responses on the sheet of paper and to answer the following questions: 1) what is the poem about or what does it mean? and 2) do you like it and why or why not?</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p11">The only task that remains is the heart of the matter, to present the profiles and interpretations and link them in a way that demonstrates that the interpretation is the result of the identity theme.</p>
        <p class="simpara">Profiles, Interpretations, and Their Connection</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p12">All of the readers are resident on a Catholic liberal arts college campus either as students or professors. Additionally, all are of Caucasian decent. The profiles attempt to provide general additional information as well as the essential background for an understanding of the person’s identity theme.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p13"><em class="emphasis">Reader A</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p14">Reader A is a twenty-one year old female majoring in religious studies and with a minor in peace and justice studies. Because of her academic area as well as her commitment to service, she is keenly aware of pain and need and the issues of justice involved in helping those in need. She has been closely touched by the plight of abused people especially children. Through conversations with her, I have learned that she is specifically interested in how sexual and physical abuse affects victims throughout their lives. She desires very much to understand the struggle and healing process that an abused person undergoes; understanding is the key to facing such a struggle. I would state her identity theme as follows: when faced with difficulty, an understanding of its effects on the person as a whole is essential to that person’s ability to cope with the difficulty.</p>

        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p17">Reader A’s interpretation first and foremost is immediately connects the “great pain” with abuse and “Yesterday, or Centuries before” with childhood. Immediately following the connection to childhood abuse, she describes some stages of dealing with the pain that are not particularly connected to any one line of the poem but seem to be an overall feeling. The stages are apparent in her note: “pressing on, living Numbly so as not to feel/acknowledge feeling.” Her understanding of the response to abuse as expressed in the above note ends her interpretation, leading me to think that having gained an understanding of the response, she is satisfied with her interpretation. She has applied her identity theme of needing understanding in order to cope; she copes with the abuse she finds in the poem by understanding and identifying a reaction to it. Being satisfied, she moves on to her feelings towards the poem. She like it because she “can identify” with it or in other words she connects with the author’s understanding of the reaction to pain; reader A finds that the author, just like her, seeks an understanding of the reaction to pain. Yet she dislikes the some of the capitalization because she “cannot see significance of their capitalization.” Her lack of understanding is the only disturbing point. Reader A’s final conclusion as should be expected is positive because she has found her identity theme of understanding difficulty.</p>

        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p19">Reader B is a twenty-year-old female majoring in music and education with a minor in chemistry. Probably due to her musical and scientific background, she is aware of how things work together. For her, everything has a proper place and explanation. She would agree with my description of her as a “neat freak.” She finds disorder disturbing and responds to unsettling events by putting other things in her world into place, like lining up books or always making her bed. I would state her identity theme as follows: when faced with difficulty, organization is the key to maintaining sanity and staying in control.</p>

            <li>Want to be strong—Nerves sit ceremoniously—but the feelings all come back and the only way to get rid of them is to let go</li>
            <li>Honestly, this doesn’t really make sense to me. Different phrases seem like they invoke images of God “was it He, that bore…” “A Wooden way”</li>
            <li>I don’t really like it because it all just seems to be fragments, although thoughts are usually just fragments!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p21"><em class="emphasis">Interpretation as the Result of Identity Theme</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p22">Reader B is organized about her interpretation. She takes each stanza and tries to find some meaning in it. With each partial interpretation, she cites particular lines, words, or feelings that led her to her conclusion of meaning. For example, when she suggests that the poem could be about “remembering an abortion,” she calls on “stiffness,” which is probably connected to “stiff Heart.” The most interesting thing about Reader B’s response is not her interpretation but her reaction to the poem. She says that the poem “doesn’t really make sense” and then comments on her dislike of the fragmentation of the poem. Her identity theme of organization ties her inability to understand to the lack of organization in the poem. Fragments seem unconnected and disorganized to her; thus, she is left without the ability to cope with the difficulty that the poem presents her because she cannot find order in the “madness.” Unable to find order, she cannot identify with the author’s description of a reaction to pain and therefore dislikes the poem. She finds her identity theme incompatible with the poem and thus abandons it.</p>

Over the past two years, much of his life has been centered on the development of his faith. He includes God as a constant in his picture of life especially when presented with any difficulties. He is also aware that personally he has been faced with only minor difficulties. Sometimes he feels inadequate in relating to others who have experienced more traumatic events in their lives. He has also been impressed by his friends’ ability to include faith in their difficulties. I would state his identity theme as follows: when faced with difficulty, turning to God is essential to coping and surviving.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p25"><em class="emphasis">Reader C’s Interpretation</em></p>

            <li>Line 13: “First—Chill—then Stupor—then the letting go—”—process of dealing with great pain</li>
            <li>I took this poem as a way people deal with personal trauma in their life. In the first stanza I get a sense of the dust settle after a disaster has struck, and a person starting to settle down and ask: “Why did this happen to me?” Even more specifically if God is there and bearing, or helping with, the person’s pain.</li>
            <li>The second stanza is rather confusing. I don’t understand how the imagery fits with my interpretation of the poem.</li>
            <li>In the last stanza has the tone of the first, with the image of winter and cold symbolizing pain and confusion and the “Freezing persons” going through the process of dealing with pain: the shock, the confusion, and then learning to live with it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p27"><em class="emphasis">Interpretation as the Result of Identity Theme</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p28">Reader C immediately identifies “great pain” as a trauma. Then, he reacts as his identity theme would dictate: he brings God into the picture. He identifies a question that is often directed towards God: “Why did this happen to me?” His next step is to specify the question as a relation to God; he includes God as a supporting figure. His idea of God as a supportive figure does not seem to stem from any one part of the poem but more from some of the images that Reader C has identified with God such as “He bore” as Christ bearing sins. As Reader C continues with his interpretation, he admits that he cannot fit the second stanza into his interpretation. Even so, he does not abandon his interpretation but comes back to it in the third stanza. Reader C’s final paragraph does not mention God but talks of a person dealing with difficulty. To me, it seems as though Reader C finds no need to further back up his interjection of God into the poem. He deciphers difficulty, inserts God as support, and goes on dealing with the difficulty. This response is consistent with his identity theme, which calls for the presence of God whenever presented with a difficulty.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p29"><em class="emphasis">Reader D</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p30">Reader D is a late middle-aged male mathematics professor. Being mathematically minded, he expects a solution or a “right answer” to any presented problem. In addition, he has been exposed to more losses than my previous readers because of his age and experience with a large student and faculty body. Experience of death and loss always increase with age. I would state his identity theme as follows: when face with difficulty, one must seek the “right answer” in order to find resolution.</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p31"><em class="emphasis">Reader D’s Interpretation</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p32">The poem describes the feeling after a tremendous loss (perhaps the death of someone very close). The person suffering the loss becomes numb, going through life in a listless manner, oblivious to everything; focusing only on the pain. If a person survives this pain, it is remembered as a central event in his or her life. The last line brings to mind the stages of anger, denial, and resolution.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_l04">
            <li>The first paragraph brings to mind the question of whether this poem is what God suffered when Jesus suffered and died.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p33"><em class="emphasis">Interpretation as the Result of Identity Theme</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p34">Reader D identifies the “great pain” as a loss probably due to death. I ascribe this interpretation as coming from his experiences with death. He then describes the person’s reactions to the death. This interpretation probably grows out of his observations and personal experience of the difficulty of dealing with death. Although his interpretation does not seem directly related to his identity theme, his comments concerning his interpretation do. After I had read his response, he asked me if he had got it right. He wanted to know if he had come up with the right answer. He assumed that there was a correct solution to the problem I had proposed of interpreting the poem. So, rather than using his identity theme to interpret the poem, Reader D uses his identity theme to approach the poem. Reader D, it appears, struggles to understand the poem, and he responds, according to his identity theme, by trying to find the “right answer.”</p>
        <p class="simpara">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="para" id="pennington_1.0-ch06_s07_p35">Although I began this project with some doubt about the relation between a person’s approach to life and their interpretations to a poem, I have been convinced by the above examples that there is definitely a correlation between the two. Even so, I also believe that this project fails to show a direct and undeniable cause and effect relationship between a person’s identity theme and his or her approach to literature. Holland’s theory in this preliminary investigation holds up, but I still have doubts about its strength under a more vigorous examination because the correspondence found in the above examples does not have the “tight fit” described by Holland.</p>

                    <li>Bring two hard copies of their paper so that each member can read the paper, OR work in a computer lab where students can share their papers on line.

                    <li>Have two students focus on the first paper in the group. While these students are reading, have the other student read the other two student papers.</li>
                    <li>The two students should quickly fill out the peer-review sheet and then have a brief conversation about the strengths of the paper and ways the paper could be improved.</li>
                    <li>Move to the next student and follow the same process. Depending on the length of your class, you may have to reduce the peer-review groups to two students.</li>
                    <li>If time permits, ask the students to provide general comments—or ask questions—about the specific papers or the assignment overall.</li>
