</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p01">Lewis Carroll, as we found out in previous chapters, is most famous for two books: <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865) and <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em> (1872). These books follow the adventures of a seven-year-old, Alice, who tumbles down a rabbit hole (<em class="emphasis">Wonderland</em>) and enters a magic mirror (<em class="emphasis">Looking-Glass</em>), entering a nonsensical world of the imagination. If you have not already read these classic books—or wish to reread them—you can access them at the following links:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p04">In <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</em>, the sequel to <em class="emphasis">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>, Alice meets the twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who recite the following poem. It’s a long poem (as Alice worries it will be), but the episode is worth reading in full:</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p06">“‘<em class="emphasis">The Walrus and the Carpenter</em>’ is the longest,” Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.</p>

        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p11">“He ate more than the Carpenter, though,” said Tweedledee. “You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn’t count how many he took: contrariwise.”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p12">“That was mean!” Alice said indignantly. “Then I like the Carpenter best—if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.”</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p13">“But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledum.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p14">This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, “Well! They were <em class="emphasis">both</em> very unpleasant characters—”<span class="footnote" id="pennington_1.0-fn08_001">Lewis Carroll, <em class="emphasis">Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1899; University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center, 1993), chap. 4, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/CarGlas.html</a>.</span></p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p15">We might interpret the poem didactically: as a warning to children not to trust strange adults, for instance. The “eldest Oyster” refuses to follow the Walrus and the Carpenter, and he, unlike his siblings, isn’t eaten. Indeed, the poem was probably meant to mimic or even parody didactic children’s literature from the nineteenth century. It’s recited by Tweedledum and Tweedledee, after all, who “looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys” and who recite poems with great vigor, as if eager to please a teacher.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p16">There’s another possibility here, however. We can read this episode as a commentary on human beings’ relationships with the natural world. Look at the way the Walrus and Carpenter discuss the beach they’re walking on: “They wept like anything to see / Such quantities of sand: / ‘If this were only cleared away,’ / They said, ‘it would be grand!’” They wish to clear away the sand—to alter the landscape to suit their whims. That landscape is already altered: “You could not see a cloud,” the poem relates, “because / No cloud was in the sky.” What’s more, “No birds were flying overhead— / There were no birds to fly.” The natural world is marked by absence in this poem, and its two central characters weep because they cannot remove the sand from the seashore. Reading through the lens of environmental or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ecocriticism</a><span class="glossdef">A school of literary criticism that studies the depiction of the physical environment in works of literature. Ecocriticism often focuses on the way literary works depict human attitudes toward and interactions with the natural world.</span></span>, we might interpret these characters as representatives of human disregard for nature.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p17">Such a reading might also help us understand the Walrus’s and the Carpenter’s treatment of the Oysters. They don’t simply trick the Oysters for sustenance—they gorge themselves, eating every one. They need “another slice” of bread, thickly spread butter, and “pepper and vinegar besides.”</p>
    <div class="informalfigure medium block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_fx02">
        <img src="section_12/313592372ae6ad6e222fcc8a8d658471.jpg">
        <div class="copyright">
            <p class="para">Illustration by Sir John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s <em class="emphasis">Through the LookingGlass and What Alice Found There</em> (1872).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="pennington_1.0-ch08_s01_p18">Look at the illustration of this scene: you see the Carpenter looking a little sick from overeating, and oyster shells strewn all around the beach like litter. It’s a scene of excess, of ill restraint. After hearing this story, Alice can’t decide which character was most unpleasant—the Walrus, who consumed the most oysters, or the Carpenter, who seemed unrepentant for his deceit. Alice, then, sees two moral problems in what the Walrus and the Carpenter do in the poem. First, she rejects their lack of sympathy for the Oysters, and second, she rejects the wastefulness of their consumption. In the end, Alice simply decides, “Well! They were <em class="emphasis">both</em> very unpleasant characters.” Part of what makes them so unpleasant, an ecocritic might suggest, is that they view the natural world and its creatures as theirs to exploit, with no repercussions or responsibilities on their part.</p>
